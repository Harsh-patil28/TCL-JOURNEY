Topic: Control Flow in TCL â€“ switch, break, continue, and labels

Date: July 20, 2025

Control flow constructs are essential in any programming language to direct the execution based on conditions. In TCL, apart from if-elseif-else, we can use switch for multi-way branching, and break, continue, and labels for fine control inside loops.

# ðŸ”¹ Key TCL Control Flow Commands
| Command   | Description                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `switch`  | Allows multi-condition branching (like `case` in C or Java)    |
| `break`   | Exits the nearest enclosing loop                               |
| `continue`| Skips the current loop iteration and moves to the next         |
| `return`  | Exits a procedure and optionally returns a value               |
