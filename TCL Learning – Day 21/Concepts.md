Topic: TCL Lists â€“ Accessing, Iterating, and Manipulating

Date: July 21, 2025

A list in TCL is an ordered collection of elements. Lists are flexible and widely used for grouping data, iteration, and transformation. Each element can be a string, number, or even another list.

In TCL, lists are stored as space-separated strings. The list commands handle them correctly, even if elements include spaces (by using braces).
